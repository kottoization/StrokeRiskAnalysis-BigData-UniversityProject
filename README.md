## Exploratory Analysis of Stroke Risk Factors

This repository contains the project proposal and related materials for our group project in the Big Data Tools & Analytics course. The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic and health-related features with a primary focus on understanding the factors that influence the risk of stroke.

### Objective

The aim of this study is to delve into the dataset and analyze various demographic and health-related variables to identify patterns and relationships that may contribute to stroke risk.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains a wide range of variables including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, residence type, work type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke (where 0 or 1 denotes absence or presence of a stroke).

### Key Questions

The analysis will focus on answering several key questions, including but not limited to:

- Distribution of stroke cases among different genders.
- Correlation between age and the likelihood of experiencing a stroke.
- Difference in stroke prevalence between individuals with and without hypertension.
- Impact of heart disease on stroke occurrence.
- Role of marital status in stroke risk.
- Difference in stroke incidence between rural and urban residents.
- Relationship between different types of employment and stroke risk.
- Distribution of average glucose levels among individuals who have experienced a stroke.
- Correlation between BMI and stroke occurrence.
- Influence of smoking status on the likelihood of having a stroke.
- Identification of significant correlations between pairs of variables indicating potential risk factors for stroke.
- Prediction of stroke occurrence based on demographic and health-related features.
- Identification of the most important predictors of stroke risk according to the predictive model.
- Contribution of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpreting the predictive model's decisions.
- Identification of actionable insights or recommendations for stroke prevention based on analysis.

### Expectations

As we delve deeper into the dataset, we anticipate that the questions mentioned above may evolve and become more specific. Nonetheless, our primary goal remains to thoroughly analyze the data and develop a model capable of predicting stroke occurrence.
